- Read articles to prepare for next lecture on web components

    - [Custom Elements](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/customelements)

    - [Shadow DOM](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/shadowdom)

- Check your old code for possible candidates for web components: widgets that are loosely tied to application and can be reused elsewhere.
